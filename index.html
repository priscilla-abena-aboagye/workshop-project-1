            The sunflower <i> (Helianthus annuus)</i> is one of nature's most captivating creations,
            known for its bright yellow petals and unique ability to follow the sun.
            This iconic plant, native to North America, has transcended its origins
            to become a universal symbol of adoration, loyalty, and longevity.
            Its scientific name, derived from Greek words "helios" (sun) and "anthos" (flower),
            perfectly encapsulates its radiant personality.
